Clock Puncher is a small and simple program to log your working hours at the office.

It has 5 different views:

* main: start/edit/reset the clock. A small display indicates the hours counted so far;
* calendar (hotkey: 1): see/change the daily hours for any past date, using the calendar app;
* raw (hotkey: 2): inspect the raw data - debugging feature;
* weekly stats (hotkey: 3): check the weekly hours in a graph display. Total hours, average hours and working days are also available;
* monthly stats (hotkey: 4) same as the weekly graph, but shows results on a monthly basis
